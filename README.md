### Generative Adversarial Network
This project explores the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model features a generator that learns to produce realistic images and a discriminator that evaluates their authenticity. This work demonstrates the potential of GANs in generating synthetic yet convincing data, with applications ranging from image synthesis to data augmentation.
